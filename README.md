A repository for my learning and understandings of complex Algorithms that are graph related in Java.

## Depth First Search
In computer science there are many useful algorithms that operate on a graph data structure such as Depth First Search.
Before this is implemented we need to consider how graphs are stored in computer memory. 
Saving it on text file is good as it can be used a secondary storage.

This Depth First Search is written in Java, uses recursion and includes the following features:
- Method to initialise Depth First Traversal of Graph.
- Recursive Depth First Traversal for the adjacency matrix.
- Method to display the graph representation.
